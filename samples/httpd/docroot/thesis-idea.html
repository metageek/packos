<h1>PackOS: Thesis Idea</h1>

<p>My thesis idea is to create a microkernel. When I read Joachim
Liedtke's papers on L4, the ideas made sense to me, except that the
IPC system struck me as excessively complicated. I started sketching
out ideas for a microkernel that would be more minimal than L4, with
IPC based on IPv6. In 91.516, I've started implementing this
microkernel, albeit emulated in a Linux process. I call it PackOS.
</p>

<p>PackOS is highly minimal. The only kernel services are context
switching, IPv6 packet delivery, and interrupt dispatch. Along with
lock-free programming techniques, the result should be a system that
spends very little time in the kernel, which makes for some
interesting simplifications. There are no kernel threads; everything
done in the kernel is O(1), and runs to completion before returning to
user space. Also, it is my hope that minimizing time spent in the
kernel will allow me to use a monolithic kernel lock, even on an SMP
machine. The result is that the trusted kernel code can be very small
and very simple. All drivers will live in user space (similar to L4,
Minix 3.0, and some other modern systems); interrupts will be
delivered to the drivers as packets.
</p>

<p>As of this writing, my user-space PackOS has basic IPv6, UDP, and
the beginnings of TCP. It has an interface to the outside network, via
shared memory and the Linux TUN driver, and a primitive filesystem. My
goal for my 91.516 project is to complete the TCP implementation and
add an HTTP server.
</p>

<p>For my thesis, I would port PackOS to native hardware (probably x86
and PowerPC), and develop it enough to be able to understand where it
lies in the flexibility/performance tradeoff. (A nice goal would be to
implement a POSIX layer, but I'm not sure that would teach me enough
to be worth the extensive effort.) I would, of course, have to do some
research on existing microkernels, such as L4, Minix, and Coyotos.
